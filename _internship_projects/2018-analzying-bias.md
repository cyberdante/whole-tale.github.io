# Analyzing Bias in Machine Learning Research

## Projection Description

Communicating research among colleagues, peers, and community at large is bread
and butter of researchers. While doing this, it is their responsibility to
follow some basic principles like transparency and accuracy. Bias is any
deviation from truth in data collection, analysis, interpretation  and
publication. 

Recently, a diverse group of stakeholders representing academia, funding
agencies, publishers and librarians have started an effort to design clear and
measurable principles for scientific data management and stewardship called
FAIR Data Principles. FAIR stands for Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability,  and Reusability of data. With more and more researchers
following these principles it has been becoming more and more feasible to
analyze papers of other scientists. Through being able to access the data and
methods that were used to prove particular hypotheses one can repeat and/or
reproduce the original experiment from a paper. 

This project will focus on analysing bias in machine learning research, based
on some small (feasible for a 10 week internship) number of  journal papers.
The papers will be carefully selected from major machine learning journals and
conferences, and from various science and engineering fields. 

## Necessary Prerequisites:

 * Basic statistical data analysis skills are required
 * Basic Python programming skills are required 

## Desirable Skills / Qualifications:

 * Understanding p-hacking methods 

## Expected Outcomes:

 * Bi-weekly presentation to other internship/REU students. Notre Dame's
   Center for Research Computing has an active REU program with participation
   of over 20 students every summer
 * Each analyzed paper will be delivered in the form of a WholeTale container.
 * Support from the WholeTale dev team will be provided as needed
 * Final poster presentation
